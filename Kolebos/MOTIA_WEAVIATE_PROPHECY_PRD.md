  // Step 3: Data extraction based on type
  const structuredData = await extractDocumentData(extractedText, docType);
  
  // Step 4: Store in Weaviate for semantic search
  await storeDocumentVector(structuredData);
  
  // Step 5: Update CRM records
  emit("document_processed", structuredData);
}
```

async def optimize_daily_routes():
    # Step 1: Gather service requests
    requests = await get_pending_services()
    
    # Step 2: Analyze district patterns
    district_analysis = await weaviate_search(
        "historical route efficiency by district"
    )
    
    # Step 3: Predict traffic and demand
    predictions = await predict_district_demand(requests)
    
    # Step 4: Generate optimal routes
    optimized_routes = await calculate_routes(requests, predictions)
    
    # Step 5: Notify technicians
    emit("routes_optimized", optimized_routes)
```
