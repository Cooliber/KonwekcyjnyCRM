## App authentication

Chef apps use [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous auth for easy sign in. You may wish to change this before deploying your app.

## HTTP API

User-defined http routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.
