- **Destination**: `hvac_crm_platform/docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.json`
- **Content**: Comprehensive knowledge base with 25+ entities covering:
  - Project architecture and technology stack
  - Warsaw district optimization strategies
  - AI prophecy system implementation
  - Performance and security requirements
  - Development workflow and testing strategies

### 2. BACKEND_AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- **Source**: `Balony/prp-backend1.md`
- **Destination**: `hvac_crm_platform/docs/BACKEND_AI_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
- **Content**: Detailed implementation plan for Convex AI integration including:
  - HVAC predictive maintenance models
  - Warsaw-specific risk scoring
  - Transcription analysis integration
  - Performance targets and validation criteria

### 3. FRONTEND_REPORT_BUILDER_PLAN.md
- **Source**: `Balony/prp-frontend2.md`
- **Destination**: `hvac_crm_platform/docs/FRONTEND_REPORT_BUILDER_PLAN.md`
- **Content**: AI-powered report builder UI implementation plan featuring:
  - Drag-and-drop interface design

## Empty Files Handled

The following empty files from Balony were noted but not migrated:
- `Balony/prp-backend2.md` (0 bytes)
- `Balony/prps-frontend.md` (0 bytes)

## Integration Benefits

1. **Centralized Documentation**: All project knowledge now resides in the main project docs
2. **Implementation Roadmap**: Clear plans for AI integration and report builder features
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Critical project memory and relationships maintained
4. **Development Guidance**: Detailed implementation blueprints for future development

## Next Steps

1. **Review Integration**: Validate that all critical information has been properly transferred
2. **Update References**: Ensure any internal links or references point to new locations
3. **Clean Up**: Remove the now-integrated Balony directory if desired
4. **Implementation**: Use the integrated plans to guide future development work
